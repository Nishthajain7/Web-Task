# Student Grade Tracker Practice Project
## 📌 Overview

This is a practice project to help you learn and apply HTML & CSS skills.
We’ve given you the boilerplate code with a basic page structure.

## 👉 Your task is to:

1. Add a Student Grades Table (with at least 3–4 rows and headings).
2. Add a form (with some input fields and a submit button).<br>
     This is how the final page might look **without styles**.

   (The “Add Grade” button **need not work right now**. We will make it functional in the coming sessions, and a solution will be shared in a couple of days.)<br>
3. Beautify the page using CSS. You can add colors, fonts, spacing, borders, or any other styles you like. Be creative and explore as much as you can
